         <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
 <pre>
<strong>Puree:</strong>
1.	Wheat flour (two cups each 250 ml)
2.	Oil (two tablespoons of dough)
3.	Semolina (five tablespoons)
4.	Water (three quarters of a cup with a capacity of 250 ml)
5.	frying oil
6.	Salt (fist or as desired)
<strong>Filling:</strong>
1.	Boiled chickpeas (200 g)
2.	Chopped ginger (10 grams)
3.	Masala Chat (5 grams)
4.	Salt (5 grams)
5.	Whole milk (400 g)
6.	Tamarind sauce (100 g).
7.	Mint Sauce (100 g)
8.	Ripe Pomegranate Seeds (50 g)

</pre>
     <h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
     <pre><strong>Puree:</strong>
1.	Soak the semolina in water for 5 minutes.
2.	Dry it with water and set aside. Put the wheat flour in a bowl and bring the salt to it,
        then add oil and semolina and mix them with a spatula spoon that comes with long holes by scraping
        the edges and edges. Wet semolina will moisten the flour so be careful while adding water. The dough
        should be firmly kneaded until smooth. Drip a little oil and cover it with a damp cloth and leave it
        aside for 30 minutes.
3.	Spread the dough into small balls (about the size of a golf ball), then sprinkle a little flour on the
        rim and knead it into circles of 7.5 cm in diameter.
4.	Heat enough oil on the pan to fry the puré (preferably in the form of a Chinese wok pan or Indian kadai
        frying pan). The oil should be hot enough as the dough starts to buzz once in contact with the oil. 
        Add a little salt to the oil to stop the smoke, then fry the puré separately. Dip the first puree and
        gently squeeze it using a tablespoon. As you press it, you will notice its swelling, so constantly flip
        it over once the light brown color appears on it. After preparing the puree, remove it from the oil and
        put it on absorbent paper to absorb the extra oil from it.
<strong>Filling:</strong>
5.	In a mixing bowl, crush chickpeas, ginger, green pepper, salt and chat masala with your fingertips
        or whatever tool suits you.
6.	Make an opening in the pastries you previously attended and fill them with hummus mixture.
7.	Add sugar to the milk until smooth and cool. Meanwhile add mint sauce and tamarind sauce to pastries.
8.	Place sweet milk on top of pastries and garnish with coriander and pomegranate seeds.
9.	Put 4 grains on each plate and serve it as soon as it is ready to keep the dough fresh and be sure to
        eat it all at once until you enjoy the full taste once
