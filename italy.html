    <h2>Pasta Carbonara</h2>
    
    <img src="Carbon.JPG" width="40%" height="40%" >
   <pre>This simple Roman pasta dish derives its name from 'carbone' meaning coal.
    It was a pasta popular with the coal miners. The original recipe calls for guanciale,
     which is pig's cheek, but since its not easily available, we have used bacon instead.
      A pasta dish every age group would love to relish!
      </pre>
      <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
      <pre>•	1 packet spaghetti
•	100 gms bacon (cut in strips)
•	3 Eggs
•	1 Egg yolk
•	100 gms pecorino romano or parmesan, grated
•	1 tbsp olive oil
•	Black pepper (coarsely crushed)
•	to taste salt
      </pre>
      <h3><strong>How to Make it:</strong></h3>
      <pre>1.In a large pan or a saucepan, heat the olive oil and fry the bacon till crisp. Set aside.
2.In a mixing bowl, beat the whole eggs and the yollk well. Stir in the grated cheese and set aside.
3.Boil the spaghetti in abundant salty water. Drain the pasta, reserving some of the cooking water.
4.In another saucepan, toss the pasta with the egg mixture, bacon and any fat rendered from cooking
   the bacon, over very low heat.
5.Make sure that the individual strands of pasta are all coated properly with the mixture. Season 
  with salt, add the pasta water, give it a quick toss, and remove right away from the heat.
6.The sauce should have a creamy texture, which will be lost if the pasta remians on the fire
  for too long.
7.The idea is to cook the egg with the heat of the pasta, and not with the heat of the fire.
8.Serve right away with lots of pepper, freshly crushed in a pepper mill, and more Parmesan
  if desired.
