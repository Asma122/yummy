     <h2><i><strong>1. FRANCH ONION SOUP</strong></i></h2>
    
    <img src="Frenchsoup2.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" >
    <pre>French Onion Soup is a classic soup recipe for good reason!
        Sweet caramelized onions are simmered in a rich beefy broth to create a soup base that is loved by everyone!
     </pre>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
6 large red or yellow onions 
4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon of sugar
Salt
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 cups of beef stock, chicken stock, or a combination 
1/2 cup of dry vermouth or dry white wine
2 bay leaves
1 tablespoon (loose) of fresh thyme 
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
8 slices French bread
1 1/2 cups of grated Swiss Gruyere and a sprinkling of Parmesan


    </pre>
    <h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
Caramelize the onions: In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. 
Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil.
Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter and cook, 
stirring often, until the onions 
start to brown, about 15 more minutes.
Then sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of salt and continue to cook until 
the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes.
Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.
Deglaze the pot with vermouth: Add the vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom and 
sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.
Add stock and seasonings: Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the 
heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.
Season to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper. Discard the bay leaves. 
Add brandy if using.
Toast French bread slices: While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil and 
preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third of the oven.
Brush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with olive oil.
Put in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven.
Turn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and Parmesan. Return to oven when 
it's close to serving time and bake until 
the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.

    <h2><i><strong>2. COQ AN VIN</strong></i></h2>
    
    <img src="Coqauvin.jpg" width="40%" height="40%" >
    <pre>coq au vin, or chicken in wine, is a popular classic french chicken stew made
       easy with crispy chicken pieces!</pre>
          <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
<pre>
2 tablespoons olive oil
4 ounces diced bacon
8 chicken pieces ,skin on, bone in
2 teaspoons salt 
1/2-1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
1 onion, diced
8 carrots cut 
4 cloves garlic, minced
350 ml good quality red wine
1 1/4 cups low sodium chicken stock or broth
5 sprigs thyme
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 tablespoons  flour
8  frozen small whole onions 
8  cremini (brown) mushrooms thickly sliced</pre>
<h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
    Preheat the oven to 350°F | 175°C.
Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the bacon and cook until crispy 
(about 8 to 10 minutes). Transfer bacon to a plate with a slotted spoon.
Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towel and season with salt and pepper. 
Add the chicken pieces in batches of two to the leftover bacon grease 
(skin side down for chicken thighs). Sear for about 5 minutes each 
side, until skin is rendered, crispy and browned. Transfer chicken to the plate with 
the bacon. Set aside. Add the onions, carrots, salt, and pepper to the pan and cook over medium 
heat for 5 minutes, while stirring occasionally,until the onions are transparent
and lightly browned. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute). 
Pour in the Cognac/brandy, wine and chicken stock; stir to combine. Add the thyme, 
bacon, chicken, and any juices leftover from the plate into 
the pot. Bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid or foil and transfer to the oven
for 20-30, or until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the middle.
While chicken is in the oven, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan over medium heat. 
Cook the mushrooms for 8 to 10 minutes, until soft and browned. Set aside.
Remove casserole from oven and place on stove. Mash the remaining butter with the flour 
and stir into the casserole (the heat will cook any lumps out). Add the pearl onions; 
bring the casserole to a simmer and cook for a further 10 minutes, until sauce has thickened.
	Enjoy!
