  <pre>Etiquette is an important topic that we have learned almost everywhere, at home and school,
and between friends and family. It is known that these manners and customs differ from one city 
to another in the same country, so what about our difference from one country to another? 
Between countries that use sticks to eat food and others who use their hands are different and 
popular customs in each country vary according to the nature of the people and the traditions 
inherited from their ancestors, and the traveler must understand and consider People's habits 
wherever he goes, this saves him from embarrassing situations and helps in forming friendships
between him and others, and in a better understanding of the nature of the people and local culture,
as well as getting him out of his classification as a foreign tourist in a foreign country. Fatafeat
is unique in the following lines for some strange eating habits around the world.

In <i><strong>Arab countries</strong></i>, just shake your cup of coffee:
One of the habits of drinking coffee in some Arab countries, especially in the Gulf region,
is that the host continues to pour coffee into the guest's cup as soon as he finishes drinking
the cup, unless the guest shakes the cup as a sign of his thanks, sufficiency and lack of desire for more coffee.

<i><strong>Japan food stick:</strong></i>
It is known that the Japanese use thin sticks to eat food, and one of the famous habits in Japan that
they do not allow them to be passed is to put this stick in a position parallel to the edge of the table
in front of you during chewing, and they do not allow guests or tourists to break this rule if they use
sticks to eat their meals, so Be careful not to bother them, by sticking the sticks vertically into the
rice bowl while chewing.

<i><strong>Your left hand in India:</strong></i>
The rules we have in the east do not use the left hand in food as long as you are not left-handed,
and this rule intensifies and hardens in some areas of southern India, where it is not allowed to
put the left hand on the table while eating, and they consider this behavior to carry a degree of
non-purity according to their beliefs, If the person is left-handed, the rule is completely different
and he is not allowed to touch the table with his right hand.

<i><strong>Respect for adults in Korea:</strong></i>
In Korea, if someone gives you a drink, you should hold it with both hands, and never use one hand to get it, 
and also you may not start eating before the largest ones on the table start eating their food, because this in
Korean culture is evidence of respect for the elderly and giving them their place.

<i><strong>Georgia and traditional feasts:</strong></i>

after it is completely emptied.

There is no cappuccino in the afternoon nor do you order Parmesan in<i><strong> Italy:</strong></i>
In Italy there is a famous habit of cappuccino drink, they do not drink it at all in the afternoon, where they 
say that drinking cappuccino late in the day may harm the stomach so you will not see Italians drinking cappuccino
on cafes after three in the afternoon.

As for parmesan, some people consider putting Parmesan cheese on the pizza as a big mistake, like putting fish on
a plate of fine chocolate! Parmesan is also not served with a number of traditional pasta dishes, according to the
experience of some. If Parmesan is not provided with food, do not order it.

<i><strong>Bread at your table in France:</strong></i>
There are many European countries that use bread as an appetizer to be eaten before food, but in France it is used
with food and specifically with cheese as a popular meal, as we do in the Middle East, and there also they do not 
put bread on a plate but rather prefer to place it on the dining table directly.

overturn their fishing boat and continued this habit with them to this day.
