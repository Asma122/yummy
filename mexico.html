    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
1. 2 cups all-purpose flour.
2. 1/2 teaspoon salt.
3. 3/4 cup water.
4. 3 tablespoons olive oil.
    </pre>
    <h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Stir in water and oil. Turn onto a floured surface; knead 10-12 times, 
adding a little flour or water if needed to achieve a smooth dough. Let rest for 10 minutes.

          <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
<pre>

4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 jalapeno, chopped very small
2 tablespoons cumin
2 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon chili powder
Hot chili powder to taste (optional)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 pound ground beef
1 lime
1 15 oz. can black beans (drained and rinsed)
1 cup cooked rice 
</pre>
<h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
    <pre>
Saute the peppers, onion, garlic, and jalapeno over medium high heat until slightly browned. 
Combine all the spices together and season the beef with about 1 tablespoon of the combined spices. 
Brown the meat in the pan with the peppers. 
Once the meat is browned and begins sticking to the pan, add about a cup of water and the remaining spices. 
Cut the lime into wedges, squeeze the juice into the meat and stir the squeezed lime wedges right into 
the meat mixture to simmer. 
Continue simmering this mixture until the peppers and onions are totally cooked down (maybe about 1/2 hour). 
Add more water if it begins sticking again. 
Adjust seasonings to taste and remove lime wedges. Add the beans and rice and mix well, continuing to cook
until heated through. 
Serve on flour tortillas with Cilantro, lime wedges, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, salsa, lettuce, avocado etc.
