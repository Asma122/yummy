     <h2>Bibimbap</h2>
    
    <img src="Bibimbap.JPG" width="40%" height="40%" >
    <pre>   Use this recipe to make arguably the best known Korean dish around the world: bibimbap.
   What makes this meal stand out? Not only is it a Korean classic, but it's also delicious, gorgeous on the plate,
   and easily tweaked for different palates and spice levels. That means if you're a typical American or Westerner 
   who can't handle foods that are extremely spicy, homemade bibimbap is the dish for you since you can easily lower
   the spice load.The bottom line is that if you're a true fan of Korean cuisine, you should know how to make this dish,
   or at least try it. Bibimbap is to Korean cuisine what apple pie is to American cuisine.
    </pre>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <pre>1.	2 cups medium-grain Korean rice (or Japanese rice)
2.	1 large cucumber (sliced into thin strips)

    <img src="mandoo.JPG" width="40%" height="40%" >
    <pre>        Korean dumplings, known as mandoo or mandu, are a traditional, easy-to-make
         traditional food that can 
         be prepared in large quantities in advance and stored in the freezer for future use.

         Korean Lunar New Year festivities and is considered a symbol of good luck for the coming year.
          </pre>
          <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
<pre>1 pound lean ground beef (or pork)
1 onion (finely chopped)
1 cup cabbage (about 1/2 of a small cabbage head, finely chopped and parboiled)
1/2 cup tofu (1 cake, chopped)
4 ounces mung bean noodles (or sweet potato noodles, soaked, and then chopped)
3 cloves garlic (finely chopped)
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 package circular mandoo wrappers (or Japanese gyoza or Chinese wonton wrappers)
</pre>
<h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>

2.	In a large mixing bowl, gently combine ground beef or ground pork, onion, cabbage,  tofu, and noodles.
3.	In a separate small bowl, combine garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, and pepper.
4.	Pour seasoning mixture over meat and vegetables and mix with hands to combine.
5.	Place about 1 tablespoon of filling in the center of dumpling wrapper.
6.	Dip your finger in water and wet the perimeter of half of the wrapper.
7.	Fold the wrapper in half, pressing to seal and then crimp the edges. Repeat until the filling is gone.
8.	You can steam, boil, fry, or sauté the dumplings as you wish.
9.	Serve with basic dipping sauce or a spicy sauce.

    </pre>
    <h3><strong>Tips:</strong></h3>
    <pre>•	If you have extra dumpling wrappers, you can just cut them into slices and use them to make noodle soup. 
•	If you want to prepare a lot of dumplings in advance, steam the dumplings, wait for them to cool, and then freeze
        them on a parchment-lined tray. When fully frozen, transfer them to a zip-top bag for longer storage.
•	You can then use them anytime straight from the freezer without defrosting, whether you want to fry, sauté, steam,
        or use them in soup.

     <img src="kimchiRice.JPG" width="40%" height="40%" >
     <pre>         Quick, easy, and cheap to make, kimchi bokumbap is simple Korean home cooking at its best.

         fried rice is a great way to use leftover kimchi that's a bit past its prime and sourer than
         fresh kimchi. It is actually what helps make this dish special. Most Koreans enjoy kimchi every
         day of the year. Kimchi is rich in vitamins and minerals and makes for an extremely healthy food choice.

1/3 cup thinly sliced beef
3 cups rice (cooked)
Salt (to taste)
4 fried eggs
</pre>
     <h3><strong>Steps to Make It:</strong></h3>
     <pre>1.	Gather the ingredients.

and 1/2 tablespoon of the butter; sauté for another 2 to 3 minutes.

  <h2>Korean BBQ Chicken Wings (Tong Dak)</h2>
  <img src="korean-bbq-chicken.JPG" width="40%" height="40%">
  <pre>  These Korean oven-roasted barbecue chicken wings, known as tong dak or tongdak,are good for
   almost any occasion.Korean barbecue tong dak chicken wings have grown substantially in popularity
   in Korea. These days, you can find them offered practically everywhere in South Korea, and the 
   concept has been exported to the U.S. Tong dak is featured on menus from Baltimore to Chicago and
   San Francisco. Major South Korean restaurant chains such as Kyochon Chicken and Bonchon have opened
   locations in the United States, bringing their own versions of Korean barbecue chicken wings across

   just eat one. When choosing yourfresh chicken wings and drumettes at the store, bear in mind that smaller

   them in a pan on the stove, and again while roasting them in the oven. If you want to boost the hot factor for 
   these wings, add some extra kochujang—just be careful not to add too much.
